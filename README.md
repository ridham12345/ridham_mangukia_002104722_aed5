I provide the Db4O database. All users’ information must be stored in the database. I have 4 kinds of users in this system(it’s free to have more elements in the system):
        System Administrator: It’s able to have all authority in this system(create, modify, delete restaurants managers, delivery men, and customers)
        Restaurant manager: is able to modify their menu, decide to accept the order or not, choose a delivery man to finish this order.
        Delivery man: in charge of bringing food to customers.
        Customer: is able to place orders, and after that is able to write the comment toward this order.
Usernames and passwords for each kind of user.
All kinds of users must have different work areas(It means that when a user successfully login through the same user interface, the user must have different panels to continue their operations.
